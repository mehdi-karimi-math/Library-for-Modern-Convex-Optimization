## Quantum Relative Entropy (QRE) programming 

This folder contains multiple problems involving optimization over the Quantum Relative Entropy (QRE) cone. For the definition of the cone, please see [this manuscript](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07438). 

The problems are given in the MATLAB `.mat`, the the format of the optimization software package [DDS](https://github.com/mehdi-karimi-math/DDS).
