This repository provides a library of hyperbolic programming problems, a class of convex optimization problems involving constraints defined by hyperbolicity cones.

The library is organized into folders, each corresponding to a different construction method for hyperbolicity cones, including those derived from elementary symmetric polynomials, determinantal representations, and other composition-based formulations.
