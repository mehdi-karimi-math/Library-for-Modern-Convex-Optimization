In this section, we investigate an optimization problem of minimizing the entropy of a vector under both hyperbolic and linear constraints. The problem can be written as:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\min  &   \text{entr}(x)   &   \\
\text{s.t.}  &   Ax+b    & \in \Lambda_+(p,e)    \\
      &   x   & \geq \gamma \mathbf{1},
\end{aligned}
$$
